    Shop account</a> and clicking order creation date in My Orders page, you can see the details of your order. Your

                    <p>DHL shipping is the default shipping option, and it is fully traceable. Once the package leaves our fulfillment center, the delivery usually takes between 2-5 business days. You can track the parcel via <a

                    <p>Standard shipping option is only available in EU countries. Its traceability is limited. Delivery time may vary between 5 days to 6
                        weeks depending on your location and your national post service. Parcel sent via Standard shipping can be <a
                                href="https://www.ceskaposta.cz/en/trackandtrace">traced here</a> until it leaves the country
    of origin. Thereafter it can be traced on the website of the postal service in your country, if available.

    leaving the country of origin, the parcel travels to a foreign country where it is accepted at customs service. This is
    where most of the delays happen. It is unfortunate because the delivery will appear in the customer's
    post tracking system only after it is released by the customs. For example, we have one delivery which was held by
    US customs office for nearly 6 weeks.</p><p><strong>2. The package got lost. In this case, please

                    <p>PIN is a number combination that you set during the initial setup of your TREZOR. It protects your TREZOR
    from being used by unauthorized persons. Just like the PIN for your credit card, it should be only known to you.</p><p><strong>Malware-proof
    PIN entry</strong></p><p>We have invented a safe way of entering PIN so that you can use your
    TREZOR even on a computer with viruses and keyloggers (designed to capture everything as you type).</p><p>When
    your PIN is required, a PIN matrix, with dots instead of the numbers, will appear on your computer screen. The
    TREZOR display will show you which number corresponds to which number tile. The placement of the numbers will be randomly shuffled with every new PIN prompt. Every time you use
    your TREZOR, you will need to look at the device to find the actual placement of the numbers you want to enter.</p><p>This
    method protects you from keyloggers - your computer never knows what you are actually entering, only the TREZOR
    itself "translates" the clicked positions into the actual PIN numbers. It also makes it difficult for
    other people to eye up your PIN code - if somebody is looking over your shoulder, he may see you clicking some blank
    buttons, but he won't see your PIN digits. The observer would need to see both the TREZOR display and your computer
    screen at the same time, which is quite difficult if you are careful.</p><p>Still a bit of enigma to you? Take a look
    at this <a href="https://youtu.be/sx4XzJRpsig">video</a>!</p>

                    <p>The Recovery seed usually contains a sequence of 24 words - uniquely and securely generated inside
    your TREZOR when you first set it up.</p>
                    <p>It is very important to keep this backup sentence secret
    and safe!</p>
                    <p>In case your device gets lost, you will need the seed for recovery - a simple process when you
    enter the words of your seed, in the order as prompted, into a new TREZOR device. You may also use any other Bitcoin
    wallet that supports the same standard as TREZOR (<a

    not underestimate the process of writing down the seed; make sure you have all words correctly spelled and in the
    right order.</p>
                    <p>Never make a digital copy of your seed, i.e. do not store it in any form on any
    computer, mobile phone or cloud storage. Consider your seed compromised once you make a digital copy of it, even if
    you do it on an offline device such as a copy machine or a digital camera. We cannot stress this enough: only store the
    seed offline - written on a piece of paper, engraved, or with a <a
                                href="https://shop.trezor.io/">Cryptosteel</a> (not available at the moment, waiting to be restocked).</p><p>What
    does the Recovery seed actually represent?</p><p>TREZOR doesn't store anything else than a "master
    key" it its memory. The 24 words sequence, which is your Recovery seed, is the representation of your master key translated into human-readable words.</p>
                    <p>Your TREZOR creates a unique structure of private keys out of this single master key that are then used to:</p>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Sign your bitcoin transactions.</li>
                        <li>Encrypt your passwords in TREZOR Password Manager.</li>
                        <li>Log into websites, or servers via SSH.</li>
                        <li>Sign messages.</li>
                    </ul>
                    <p>This means that
    if you lose your Recovery seed, you may lose access to all of those features. Read more about "What If"

                    <p>A passphrase can be any word, a set of letters or even a sentence. You could also consider the
    passphrase to be the 25th word of the seed, as with the passphrase an entirely wallet will be generated.</p><p>Your passphrase should be memorable, though.
    Typically, you would not write it down anywhere, to eliminate any possibility of it being discovered. Remember that
    you are entering the passphrase directly into the computer, and this process is not protected against keyloggers
    like the PIN entry. For this reason, you should not be tempted to disable your PIN even if you use the passphrase feature!</p><p>If
    you enable the passphrase protection, you will be asked for a passphrase every time you connect your TREZOR and work
    with a bitcoin (altcoin) wallet such as TREZOR Wallet or Electrum.</p><p>The passphrase has a triple
    security effect.</p><p>1. It makes your TREZOR impervious to physical attack. Even if your TREZOR was
    stolen and the chip examined under an electron microscope to discover your recovery seed, your bitcoins will still
    be safe!</p><p>2. It protects your bitcoins in case someone steals your Recovery seed from you. Without
    your passphrase, the thief won't be able to access your coins.</p><p>3. A passphrase or more passphrases
    can be used with the same TREZOR device to create the so-called "hidden wallets," giving you a great
    advantage in situations such as being held at a gunpoint, (also known as the $5-wrench-attack). Use different
    passphrases to create "decoy" wallets with a low balance next to your main wallet. <a

If you're not sure, which driver to update, you can try to unplug and plug your TREZOR again, to see if there are some changes in the current section of "Device manager". Deleting the needed driver can also do the trick, as the system will update the driver automatically.

                    <p>There is a small problem with TREZOR Bootloader 1.3.0, which prevents the device from being properly recognized if a user holds the device buttons pressed for a longer-than-necessary amount of time.
                   The problem can be resolved by pressing the buttons only for a short amount of time (click) when entering Bootloader mode.
                   </p>
                    <strong>We would suggest trying these instructions:</strong>
                   <ul>
                       <li>Plug micro-USB into TREZOR.</li>
                       <li>Align USB-A to a port on your computer.</li>
                       <li>Plug the USB-A into your computer. At the same time, click both buttons on your TREZOR.</li>
                       <li>The device should boot up in Bootloader mode, and the computer should recognize it.</li>
                       <li>If the computer does not recognize your TREZOR, please try again. Timing is essential.</li>
                        <li>Windows users, please check Device Manager if TREZOR is not recognized repeatedly.</li>
                   </ul>
                    <p>It should be resolved with a click rather than holding down the buttons. We have reports that it helped to quickly release the buttons when plugging the USB cable.
                    Even trying it with the different USB cables or ports can yield the better results. If none of these is working then we will face the next step in troubleshooting.</p>

There is no limit for the claiming, you can do it anytime you want.

                        <a href="https://wallet.trezor.io/">TREZOR Wallet</a> is the official production-level, battle-tested version of the web-wallet interface provided by SatoshiLabs. It is feature-conservative, meaning new functions are added at a slower pace and only after they are thoroughly tested, to ensure the highest reliability of the wallet. The purpose of this wallet is to provide a continuous and stable access to TREZOR.
                    <br/><br/>
                        <a href="https://beta-wallet.trezor.io/">TREZOR Beta Wallet</a> is a less-tested version of the web-wallet. New features are first released here before we consider them as sufficiently reliable for the production wallet. It serves as a public feature-testing platform for the TREZOR community, providing power users with quick access to new features.
                    <br/><br/>
                        Wallets can be used interchangebly, as they are only the interface to your TREZOR device.

                        TREZOR (the device) supports Bitcoin Gold. As previously mentioned, at the moment of the fork, if you have bitcoins on your TREZOR, you will also have a possibility to claim bitcoin gold on your TREZOR (both new and legacy accounts are supported in bitcoin gold) once the bitcoin gold network is active. If you simply wish to hold BTC and BTG, there is no further action required from you.
                    <br/><br/>
                        <strong>UPDATE: </strong>Bitcoin Gold seems to have implemented replay protection. We will now begin our works on developing support in the Wallet and a method to split the coins. Bitcoin Gold network is not live yet, only the testnet is running. The automated coin-splitting tool will, most likely, be adapted to support BTG too.
We will release more information as we progress with our development.

                        <li>TREZOR T runs on entirely new firmware called TREZOR Core. It will allow much faster development for new features, some of which will be portable back to TREZOR One.</li>
                        <li>New software stack means easier integration for new coins (more supported cryptocurrencies).</li>

                    <strong>What happens to TREZOR One in the future?</strong>
                    <br/>
                    We will keep selling TREZOR One even when TREZOR T is out. Those two models are focusing different market segment and should not be a competition for each other. We will keep supporting TREZOR One, including security updates.
